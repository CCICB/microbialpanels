The goal of microbialpanels is to provide curated lists of microbes relevant to specific applications

## Installation

You can install the development version of microbialpanels like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes") # Install remotes package if you haven't already got it
remotes::install_github("CCICB/microbialpanels")
```

## Usage

```{r example}
library(microbialpanels)

# List available panels
panels_available()

# Load a panel of interest
panels_load('CancerViruses')
```

All panels have the following columns:

-   ScientificName

-   Taxid

-   Type

-   Rank

Panel tables may have additional columns that vary from one panel to another
